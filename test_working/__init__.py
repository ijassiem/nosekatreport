"""A Package Testing The fitness for purpose of small shiney objects

It is critical to test the fitnees for purpose of various small
shiney objects we create here at SmallShineyCo Ltd. If we do not do
this, our clients might end up going with the cheaper moderately sized
dull objects from our competitors.

We test fitness by poking, bashing, bending and bedevilling sample
shiney objects until they break. We also check how much such abuse
they can take before they stop working, and of course whether they
worked in the first place.
